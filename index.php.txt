<h1>Multi-Device Website</h1>

<p>From smartphones to tablets to everything in between, a wider variety of 
computing devices than ever before are being used to get online. 
These devices have different screen sizes and resolutions, input methods, 
and even different modes of use. Most organizations have responded to 
this new reality by creating separate experiences for new devices types: 
a separate mobile site, a separate tablet site, and so on. But todayâ€™s 
devices are blurring even these lines.</p>
